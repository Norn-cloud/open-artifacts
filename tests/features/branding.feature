Feature: Instance identity beyond the landing page
  As a visitor of an artifact page, its header, or its error states
  I want every touchpoint that names the service to agree on whose instance it is
  So that a branded deploy reads as its brand everywhere, not just on "/"

  Scenario: The viewer header names the configured brand and links home
    Given a published artifact
    When I GET /a/:id with BRAND_NAME set to "coda0"
    Then the header shows a "coda0" brand chip linking to "/"

  Scenario: A self-hosted deploy without BRAND_URL shows no brand chip
    Given a published artifact
    When I GET /a/:id on a self-hosted host with no BRAND_URL set
    Then the header shows no brand chip

  Scenario: A self-hosted deploy with BRAND_URL shows the neutral Open Artifacts credit
    Given a published artifact
    When I GET /a/:id on a self-hosted host with BRAND_URL set to its own URL
    Then the header shows an "Open Artifacts" brand chip linking to that BRAND_URL

  Scenario: A branded deploy ignores a stray BRAND_URL and still links home
    Given a published artifact
    When I GET /a/:id with BRAND_NAME set and BRAND_URL set to something else
    Then the header still shows a brand chip linking to "/", not to BRAND_URL

  Scenario: An authenticated account avatar appears in the artifact header
    Given a published artifact and an authenticated coda0 account with a picture URL
    When I GET /a/:id
    Then the account header uses the picture URL as its avatar image
    And the account header keeps the user's initial as an image-load fallback
    And the host CSP allows only coda0 identity-provider avatar hosts

  Scenario: The artifact header keeps the account slot before the brand
    Given a published branded artifact with account controls
    When I GET /a/:id
    Then the account slot appears immediately before the brand at the right edge
    And the handoff control appears immediately before the comments and theme controls
    And the comments and theme controls appear before the account slot

  Scenario: Not-found reads "Go to" the configured brand
    When I GET /a/nonexistent with BRAND_NAME set to "coda0"
    Then the response status is 404
    And the page links "Go to coda0"

  Scenario: Not-found reads "Go to Open Artifacts" without brand env
    When I GET /a/nonexistent without brand env
    Then the response status is 404
    And the page links "Go to Open Artifacts"

  Scenario: Invalid version reads "Go to" the configured brand
    Given a published artifact
    When I GET /a/:id?v=notanumber with BRAND_NAME set to "coda0"
    Then the response status is 400
    And the page links "Go to coda0"

  Scenario: The OG card wordmark uses the configured brand wordmark
    Given an artifact's title and description
    When the OG card SVG is built with BRAND_NAME "coda0" and BRAND_WORDMARK "CODA0"
    Then the card's wordmark reads "CODA0" instead of "OPEN ARTIFACTS"
