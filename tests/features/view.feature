Feature: View an artifact
  As a viewer with a shared link
  I want the artifact to render as a complete, safe web page
  So that I can read it without needing any account

  Scenario: Viewer wraps content in a full HTML skeleton
    Given a published artifact whose stored content is a body fragment
    When I GET /a/:id
    Then the response is a complete HTML document with doctype, head, and body
    And the head contains the artifact title
    And the head contains an emoji favicon as an SVG data URI
    And a minimal CSS reset is inlined

  Scenario: Strict CSP isolates the artifact frame from external requests
    When I GET /a/:id/frame
    Then the Content-Security-Policy header forbids all external hosts
    And inline styles and scripts are allowed
    And images are allowed only from data: or blob: URIs

  Scenario: Theme awareness
    When I GET /a/:id
    Then the page responds to prefers-color-scheme
    And a data-theme attribute on the root element overrides the OS scheme

  Scenario: The artifact presents as a sheet on a quiet backdrop
    Given a published HTML artifact
    When I GET /a/:id/frame
    Then the frame root paints a themed backdrop tone derived from the surface token
    And the body presents the artifact as a rounded, hairline-bordered sheet inset from the frame viewport
    And the window stays the scroll container so recorded handoff scroll keeps working

  Scenario: Canvas artifacts keep the full-bleed plane
    Given a published canvas artifact whose plane carries a transform
    When I GET /a/:id/frame
    Then the frame detects the canvas mode before first paint
    And the sheet inset is removed so the plane owns the full frame viewport

  Scenario: Authored sticky headers pin inside the sheet edge
    Given a published HTML artifact whose own CSS pins a sticky header at the viewport top
    When I GET /a/:id/frame
    Then the frame re-pins the sticky header below the sheet's top inset

  Scenario: The host page itself stays full-bleed behind the frame
    Given a published HTML artifact
    When I GET /a/:id
    Then the host page carries no sheet presentation of its own
    And the artifact frame keeps its fixed full-bleed positioning below the header

  Scenario: Service header chrome is isolated from author CSS
    Given a published HTML artifact whose own CSS styles the ".oa-title" class
    When I GET /a/:id
    Then the resident service header names its title with a reserved class
    So the generator only supplies data and cannot restyle the header

  Scenario: Service header remains usable on a narrow viewport
    Given a published artifact with a long title and secondary controls
    When I view the artifact on a narrow viewport
    Then the favicon and truncated title remain visible
    And comments and theme remain directly available
    And the remaining artifact controls are available from a More panel
    And a secondary dock returns focus to the visible More trigger when closed

  Scenario: Unknown artifact id
    When I GET /a/doesnotexist
    Then the response status is 404

  Scenario: View a specific version
    Given an artifact with 3 versions
    When I GET /a/:id?v=2
    Then the content of version 2 is served

  Scenario: Raw content is readable for agents
    When I GET /api/artifacts/:id/raw
    Then the stored content is returned unwrapped
